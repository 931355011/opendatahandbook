Identifying the type of open data that can help a business grow involves not only understanding what open data is, but also creative thinking around what can be done with the data. Once a useful data source is identified, a business owner must assess the risks and decide how to integrate the data into their product. While the first part of open data use relies...

It shows that one of the biggest beneficiaries of government open data programs can be government itself. This may seem surprising as government already has access to its own data. However, in reality, there are many obstacles to effective information sharing within government - so that even if data exists, friction may prevent it “flowing” to where it is most needed and most valuable.
We emphasize this point that government itself is a major beneficiary of...
